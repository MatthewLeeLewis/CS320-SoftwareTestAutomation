# CS320-SoftwareTestAutomation

# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Functionality is the primary purpose one thinks of when thinking of testing. In this course, I learned how to write JUnit tests to test my code, asserting that everything worked as intended. I also learned to check coverage and ran my tests to ensure they all passed and achieved 100% coverage of the code. To ensure security, it is important to verify that outdated libraries are not used and system exploits do not exist within the code as well as many other factors outside of the scope of this class.

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
This is primarily done via the system requirements document. This document was created by discussing the needs with the customer. By designing the code around this document, I can ensure that all needs are met based on the information in the document.

# How do I approach designing software?
As mentioned before, I begin with the system requirements document. After this, I consider the best approach for coding each bit of functionality, carefully formatting with whitespace, standard naming conventions, and comments to make the code more easily understood and readable. I also try to consider any functionality that will be used more than once so it can be executed using methods. Doing this allows the code to not only be more readable and understandable, but allows further edits to the code based on testing or changed needs to be done more smoothly and with greater efficiency.
